                    <b>I think you should be an AI Engineer!</b>
                    <br/> 
                    Artificial intelligence can be challenging. It deals with a lot of math and at times uses complex algorithms. However,
                    it is a very rewarding field with high compensation. It also has the benefits of being future proof due to the huge boom of 
                    machine learning. Being a part of a rapidly changing industry can be exciting and you have the potential to be at the forefront of a 
                    new and luractive adventure. 
                    <br/>
                    From what you've told me. I think this job would pair well with your preferences! So, I think that's it!

                    <b>I think you should be a Software Developer!</b>
                    <br/> 
                    Software development is something common to a lot of Computer Science graduates. It requires a bit of math, but there are several 
                    roles that don't need as much paving way for people who have a lot of programming experience and know a lot of languages but might lack some math skills. The compensation 
                    is still generous and while it might not be as future proof as fields that do use machine learning, it is still very stable. Working remotely
                    is simple for this kind of job and there are several positions for work from home employees in software development.

                    <b>I think you should be a Game Developer!</b>
                    <br/> 
                    Game development is a rewarding career that covers a lot of disciplines. If you have a broader set of skills, there is a huge variety of 
                    interactive media that you can create. While the pay might be lower initially than some of the other more technical careers, over time compensation
                    will become more competitive as you gain experience. The freedom of being able to potentially work with music, user interfaces, and possibly have cool
                    social interactions with end users make this career fulfilling. However, some of these companies prefer in office work due to IP concerns so be mindful of this.

                    <b>I think you should be an Information Security Analyst!</b>
                    <br/> 
                    An Information Security Analyst is a very sensitive but rewarding career. You deal with data hiding, cryptology, and the ethics that govern the information you're protecting.
                    Information security allows those who have a varied disciple to show off their various skills. Things leadership and a strong understanding of ethical code can allow you to 
                    accel in this field. The compensation is good and due to growth of AI there is a larger concern of the security of data making this job more in demand for the future. Working remotely
                    is possible, but due to the nature of data some companies might only allow office access as well as highly guarded tokens and other security clearances.

                    <b>I think you should be a Network Engineer!</b>
                    <br/> 
                    Networking can be a much simpler job than other computer science related fields. That, however, doesn't mean there aren't challenges or that the career will not be rewarding!
                    Networking has the benefits of being able to be done remotely. A lot of network engineering can be done with virtual machines and accessing remote desktops to manipulate various devices.
                    Some intrusion protection systems might be physical and sometimes equipment might need configuration, but there are several opportunities for flexible work. The field also does not require
                    a lot of mathematical prowess which is a boon for those who dislike math or just don't want it a large focus. Having a flexible job that might be a little simpler while still having solid
                    pay is very desirable in today’s climate.
