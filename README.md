A college project that creates a fun and simple chatbot that determines the proper career path for the student.

# CareerBot Instructions
**1.** Open a web browser and through it, goto https://pandorabots.com and login to your account. If you don't have an account, please create one.

**2.** Afterwards, navigate to https://home.pandorabots.com/dash/bot-directory or if you're on the dashboard just look at the left 
navigation pane and select "Directory".

**3.** Once on the page, there is a search bar in the top right. Enter the name CareerBot-010663003 and press enter or click
the search glass to search.

**4.** Click the bot that displays in the search results with the correct name. 

**5.** After selected, the orange chat circle in the bottom right should open, but if it does not, click the orange chat circle and
it should display the chat window to interact with the bot.

**6.** Verify that the correct bot is selected by looking at the title and ensuring it says CareerBot-010663003.

**7.** Say "hello" without quotes to begin the conversation with the chat bot. 

**8.** The chat bot will guide you through the conversation, but please try to answer the question the chat bot is 
asking. While it does have a lot of features to ensure the conversation goes relatively smoothly, it isn't robust
enough to know every situation and works best when you answer the questions it directly asks. 

**9.** After answer all of the chat bot's questions the bot will offer a job recommendation. Once this has happened, you can thank
the bot or restart by saying "hello" again without quotes.
